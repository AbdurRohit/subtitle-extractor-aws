00:21:21.747 --> 00:21:22.780
            IT'S ALL YOUR FAULT,
            KRONK.              

00:21:22.815 --> 00:21:25.916
            I TOLD YOU WE SHOULD
            HAVE TURNED HIM     
            INTO A HIPPO.       

00:21:25.951 --> 00:21:28.419
    THERE YOU HAVE IT.          
    I, KUZCO, WON THE RACE.     

00:21:28.454 --> 00:21:31.088
    AND AS YOU CAN SEE,         
    THE POTION WORE OFF         

00:21:31.123 --> 00:21:33.557
    AND I'M BACK TO MY          
    HANDSOME HUMAN SELF.        

00:21:33.592 --> 00:21:35.893
        THOUGH I DO HAVE        
    A CRAVING FOR CARROTS.      

00:21:35.928 --> 00:21:39.997
ANYWAY, LOOKS LIKE YOURS TRULY

00:21:40.032 --> 00:21:42.933
    FROM KUZCO ACADEMY          
    AND STAY EMPEROR.           

00:21:42.968 --> 00:21:45.936
    AS FOR KRONK, WELL,         
    TO MAKE UP FOR HIS MISTAKE, 

00:21:45.971 --> 00:21:48.472
    HE BAKED YZMA SOME OF       
    HIS FAVORITE SPINACH PUFFS. 

00:21:48.507 --> 00:21:51.875

    WITH A LITTLE SOMETHING     
    I LIKE TO CALL...           

00:21:54.913 --> 00:21:58.382
        RABBIT PUFFS.           

00:22:02.688 --> 00:22:07.325
            KUZCOOOOO!          

00:22:09.761 --> 00:22:10.727
Kuzco: YOU KNOW, NOT EVERYONE   
CAN BE AS PERFECT AS ME.        

00:22:10.762 --> 00:22:13.530
CHECK OUT THIS LITTLE BLOOPER   
FROM TODAY'S SHOW.              

00:22:13.565 --> 00:22:14.998
        HEY, WHAT'S UP?

        A CHANCE TO ASK YOU--   

00:22:23.041 --> 00:22:24.641

00:22:24.676 --> 00:22:25.575
    UH...                       

00:22:25.611 --> 00:22:29.646
        IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE     
        "SCROLL" NOT "SQUIRREL."

00:22:29.681 --> 00:22:30.881
            PROPS!
